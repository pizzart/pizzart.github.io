<h2>hi</h2>
<p>hi! it's been more than 7 months since the last update, and once again i've got a few things to share.</p>
<h2>games</h2>
<p>back in january our group made another game: <a href="https://pizzart.itch.io/attack-of-the-mutant-veggies">Attack of the Mutant Veggies</a> (another great title). sadly for the next ludum dare everyone was busy, so i decided to do compo: <a href="https://pizzart.itch.io/package-passage">Package Passage</a>. i think the game turned out pretty fun.</p>
<h2>music</h2>
<p>recently i've been getting back into making music, and i can share a few tracks i've made: <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/RE1fZ">poor drums</a>, <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/Cy4WP">perfume stain</a>, and a "sequel" to my old track "high speed chase": <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/s5TkM">higher speed chase</a>. i really don't know how to name tracks</p>
<h2>photography</h2>
<p>i like doing photography now, especially editing the photos. i've dug up a 10 year old camera and started taking more photos, but now even if i don't take it with me i still take pictures with my phone. there's a bunch of attached images below</p>
<h2>art?</h2>
<p>i really haven't done a lot of art in a while, but the artworks i have done are alright. i also came back to drawing on paper, it's interesting to draw with ink</p>
<h2>ongoing project</h2>
<p>i've also been working on a small multiplayer movement fps of sorts: <a href="https://youtu.be/7rzlngHog84">smallfps movement demo</a>. thank you godot 4 for making multiplayer easier</p>
<h2>finshed projects?</h2>
<p>i made a python program that analyzes a user's games ratings on ludum dare and puts them on a graph: <a href="https://github.com/pizzart/jam-analysis">LD rating graph tool</a>. i like visualizing data now. working with matplotlib and selenium was not that difficult, surprisingly. though i probably will not understand any of the code i wrote if i look at it now. regardless, it's a neat little project.</p>
<h2>laptop update</h2>
<p>btw i did actually get the laptop i mentioned in the last blogpost! it's super small and i love it. i don't take it outside very often though because i don't need it most of the time (which is a bit dumb since i wanted to take it everywhere) but i still use it all the time at home and i'm actually selling my old pc since i don't need it anymore. the laptop is not that powerful but it's enough for my needs.</p>
<h2>website update</h2>
<p>the website has been updated once again, this time the design is mac-OeSque (uhhh) with the buttons on the top left and stuff. i don't know why i keep doing these pointless redesigns but it's fun</p>
<h2>bye</h2>
<p>see you in another 6 months or so</p>
<p>
