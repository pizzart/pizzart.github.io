# bi-annual update #2!

## hi

hi! it's been more than 7 months since the last update, and once again i've got a few things to share.

## games

back in january our group made another game: [Attack of the Mutant Veggies](https://pizzart.itch.io/attack-of-the-mutant-veggies) (another great title). sadly for the next ludum dare everyone was busy, so i decided to do compo: [Package Passage](https://pizzart.itch.io/package-passage). i think the game turned out pretty fun.

## music

recently i've been getting back into making music, and i can share a few tracks i've made: [poor drums](https://on.soundcloud.com/RE1fZ), [perfume stain](https://on.soundcloud.com/Cy4WP), and a "sequel" to my old track "high speed chase": [higher speed chase](https://on.soundcloud.com/s5TkM). i really don't know how to name tracks

## photography

i like doing photography now, especially editing the photos. i've dug up a 10 year old camera and started taking more photos, but now even if i don't take it with me i still take pictures with my phone. there's a bunch of attached images below

## art?

i really haven't done a lot of art in a while, but the artworks i have done are alright. i also came back to drawing on paper, it's interesting to draw with ink

## ongoing project

i've also been working on a small multiplayer movement fps of sorts: [smallfps movement demo](https://youtu.be/7rzlngHog84). thank you godot 4 for making multiplayer easier

## finshed projects?

i made a python program that analyzes a user's games ratings on ludum dare and puts them on a graph: [LD rating graph tool](https://github.com/pizzart/jam-analysis). i like visualizing data now. working with matplotlib and selenium was not that difficult, surprisingly. though i probably will not understand any of the code i wrote if i look at it now. regardless, it's a neat little project.

## laptop update

btw i did actually get the laptop i mentioned in the last blogpost! it's super small and i love it. i don't take it outside very often though because i don't need it most of the time (which is a bit dumb since i wanted to take it everywhere) but i still use it all the time at home and i'm actually selling my old pc since i don't need it anymore. the laptop is not that powerful but it's enough for my needs.

## website update

the website has been updated once again, this time the design is mac-OeSque (uhhh) with the buttons on the top left and stuff. i don't know why i keep doing these pointless redesigns but it's fun

## bye

see you in another 6 months or so
