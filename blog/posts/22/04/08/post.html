<p>i've been very busy with life, for the past couple of months i've made some artwork, made some music, got a graphics tablet, made some digital artwork, made some games, wrote some code
here are some things i made when i got the tablet



i also made a few """EPs""": <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/sets/display-technology">1</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/sets/storage-technology">2</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/sets/chill-vibes">3</a>, and a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/sounds-from-the-arcade">single track</a> made in FamiStudio
I plan on making more stuff like this, despite the tracks being amateur at best it still gives me experience
my friends and I have also made 2 games back in October and a few days ago: <a href="https://pizzart.itch.io/rocknrover">Rock'n'Rover</a> and <a href="https://pizzart.itch.io/hypercrastinate">Hypercrastinate</a> respectively (hypercrastinate's name might've been inspired by a certain game about a drifter in a world of hyper light)
I also updated the website a bit, the most notable change being the font changer on the home page (it needs javascript on every page where I want the font to change, which is not something I really want (I might change the font to not have javascript on every single page of this website))
it's been fun these past few months, I've had some ups and downs, it's both interesting and sad to see how much has changed in the world
Tea's also been making <a href="https://teawide.xyz/blog">blogposts</a>, they are pretty cool and inspiring</p>
