### semi-burnt out

i spent half of october and the entirety of november making games! it has been both super fun and extremely exhausting. i'm taking a bit of a break from game dev and finding other fun things to do.

### the star of the show

[VERSUS SNAKE](https://pizzart.itch.io/versus-snake)

this game was made in 48 hours (or around 32 if you count the fact that i had a failed prototype of a point-and-click game that did not feel entertaining, see [attachments](#attachments)). as usual, i did not expect to get a high rating or anything of the sorts, certainly not a PLACE IN THE [GTMK GAME JAM 2023 WINNERS VIDEO](https://youtu.be/tYxZ_LOlFnU). it was amazing seeing our game being noticed and praised. the concept is not even that complicated! huge thanks to Levi for the idea, sound effects and the main (genuinely spooky) track ([website](http://levivbaudio.com/)) and TwoSpaces for the menu and credits themes ([soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/twospaces8912)). certainly one of our proudest moments over the last 3 years. now onto the other games:

### the others

- [[in frame]](https://pizzart.itch.io/in-frame) - made for ludum dare 54. a photography game! it has a pretty unique concept of taking pictures in such a way that all the objects need to be in the frame of the camera. it doesn't explore the concept that deeply but the vibe of the game is quite spooky. 18th place for innovation! thanks to tea for helping with programming, art, coming up with the name and designing the banner.
- [Skyward](https://pizzart.itch.io/skyward) - made for the scream jam 2023. i made it over the span of a week with my friend helping with the models and textures. i've had a few people call it similar to another horror game about collecting papers... even though i've never played it. the game was one of the gHosts's choice!

### and now, the final game of the year

[Metamorphosis](https://pizzart.itch.io/metamorphosis) - made for the month long (!) github game off 2023 jam. this was my first time making a game for an entire month. !!!! i'll probably write something about it later (how it has references and stuff) (and how i made breakcore for it)

### the music

- [祈祷无果](https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/pray) - my friend was messing around with a chinese ai voice generator, and i knew what i had to do... as soon as i started chopping the vocals the track went from pretty good to actually fire. the friend also made the cover, which features quite an interesting man... anyways
- [noStalgic tHIng buT not reall_y](https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/nostalgic-thing-but-not-reall_y) - made this after a long break and it was fine
- [meat grinder core](https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/meat-grinder-core) - kinda goes hard ngl
- [WHEN YOU CAN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING RIGHT](https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/fuck) - i was really frustrated with my musical ideas not going anywhere so i turned those feelings into a track. it's not good but represents what i felt at the time well

#### osts!

- [Package Passage OST](https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/sets/package-passage) - made for package passage, obviously. it has a 90s hip hop style that i enjoy
- [Metamorphosis OST](https://soundcloud.com/pizzarte/sets/metamorphosis-ost) - a huge inspiration for it were the Hyper Light Drifter and OneShot soundtracks, plus a bunch of jungle/breakcore i'd listened to over the last 6 months. it's the first time i incorporated a leitmotif into the soundtrack (which makes sense since i've only made 2 soundtracks)

## JUNE UPDATE

### life takes time

a lot has happened since february, for example:

### [PRINTTOWN!](https://pizzart.itch.io/printtown)

it was made for the acerola jam 0 in 2 weeks back in march. i had so much fun developing it and sharing my progress with the community on discord! felt great seeing people excited about the style of the game and its parkour elements. [it was even featured as an honorable mention during the top 10 reveal](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2125227088?t=00h22m50s)! i was super excited to see it being praised by people and acerola himself!

in my personal opinion, this is the best game i've made in terms of mechanics. not the battle stuff, that part is repetitive. the platforming, on the other hand... quite possibly the most entertained i've been playing my own game.

in retrospect, i should have spent more time developing the battles, not written any meta stuff in the dialogues and reduced the difficulty of the collectibles. unfortunately, i overscoped by making an OPEN WORLD GAME for a GAME JAM, though i'm still impressed with how much i was able to make in just 2 weeks.

### [cheezard](https://pizzart.itch.io/cheezard)

this is a very simple game my friend and i made in just 16 hours for ludum dare 55. for the amount of work put into it the game is surprisingly fun and even kind of addicting.

### music

i've been producing an album since the start of april, it's my most experimental work to date. i am not going to release it under the pizzart name. it'll stay as a little album full of venting in the sea that is the internet.

### art

i have not been drawing that much. i've been doing little sketches and practices very very occasionally (see attachments). also catboy jerma

## november update...

### how much longer is this going to take

it is currently the 20th of november. i am SET on finishing this goddamn blogpost

### life...

ok i am not going to talk about it. let's just say it's been a wild ride

### games

[FishTaxi](https://odinvii.itch.io/fishtaxi): yeah this is silly lol

kind of an overscoped nightmare,, also it's boring

there is another game i made that i will not share

### music

i haven't released anything under the pizzart name since spring..

### anyways

consider me gone off the face of the internet, i do not exist
